# Ontomasticon

Ontomasticon is a simple, lightweight ontology and glossary server written in PHP and making use of MariaDB or MySQL.

## Etymology

"The term onomastikón (collection of names, from ὄνομα/ónoma, ‘name’) describes learned works that are not arranged alphabetically but juxtapose synonyms and terms relating to the same semantic field." ([Brill's New Pauly](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/onomastikon-e831390))

"An ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject." ([Ontology, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(computer_science)))
